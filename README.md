### Description
`H2Woah!` is a data-driven exploration project focused on the water landscapes of four distinct states: Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. Leveraging the power of Django, our web application is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of water bodies based on the dataset sourced from the water body survey published in 2023 by data.gov.in.

### Goals:
`H2Woah!` aims to contribute to the understanding of water ecosystems by investigating the distribution of water bodies in specific states and examining the influence of urbanization on water resources.

### Features:
* **Data Tab:**
  Explore the raw dataset in the 'Data' tab, offering a transparent view of the information extracted from the authoritative source.

* **EDA Tab (Exploratory Data Analysis):**
  Immerse yourself in the 'EDA' tab, where we've crafted customizable and interactive exploratory data visualizations. Uncover patterns, relationships, and trends to better understand the distribution of water   bodies in each state.

* **Descriptive Statistics Tab:**
In the 'Descriptive Statistics' tab, dive deep into numerical insights derived from the dataset. Gain a nuanced understanding of how factors such as urbanization impact the water landscape, as we present key statistical summaries for comprehensive analysis.

### Data Source:
The project relies on data.gov.in's water body survey published in 2023, ensuring reliability and credibility in our analysis.
